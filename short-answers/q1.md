# !BONUS Question BONUS!
Why were `rounder()` and `measureRain()` able to use switch cases, while
functions like `happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` were not? Do you prefer `measureRain()` and `rounder()` as `if/else` or `switch` statements?

# Answer
Switch cases test expressions based off strict equality and typically only deal with a single data type. If and Else conditions can test for conditions involving logical operator and a range in values. I personally like `measureRain()` and `rounder()` as `switch` statements since they are much easier to read.
